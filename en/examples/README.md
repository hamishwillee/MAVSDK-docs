# C++ Examples

> **Tip** Information about *writing* example code is covered in the [Contributing > Writing Plugins](../contributing/plugins.md) (*plugin developers* should initially create [integration tests](../contributing/plugins.md#integration_tests) rather than examples for new code).

The examples are "largely" built and run in the same way, as described in the following section (any exceptions are covered in the page for the associated example).

> **Warning** Some of the examples define flight behaviour relative to the default home position in the simulator (e.g. [Fly Mission](../examples/fly_mission.md)).
  Care should be taken if using them on a real vehicle.

## Trying the Examples {#trying_the_examples}

The easiest way to test the examples is to use a [simulated PX4 vehicle](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/simulation/) that is running on the same computer.
First start PX4 in SITL (Simulation), optionally start *QGroundControl* to observe the vehicle, then build and run the example code.

> **Note** The simulator broadcasts to the standard PX4 UDP port for connecting to offboard APIs (14540).
  The examples connect to this port using either [add_any_connection()](../api_reference/classmavsdk_1_1_mavsdk.md#classmavsdk_1_1_mavsdk_1a229888e2931c16d11edbed07b03174d4) or [add_udp_connection()](../api_reference/classmavsdk_1_1_mavsdk.md#classmavsdk_1_1_mavsdk_1a868d224223d2f4e8de7d5e00863b6ceb).


### Setting up a Simulator

PX4 supports a [number of simulators](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/simulation/).
In order to set up the [jMAVSim](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/simulation/jmavsim.html) or [Gazebo](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/simulation/gazebo.html) simulator, you can simply follow the standard PX4 toolchain setup instructions for [macOS](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/setup/dev_env_mac.html) or [Ubuntu Linux](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/setup/dev_env_linux.html).

> **Note** JMAVSim can only be used to simulate multicopters.
  Gazebo additionally supports a number of [other vehicles](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/simulation/gazebo.html#html#running-the-simulation) (e.g. VTOL, Rovers, fixed-wing etc.).

After running a standard installation, a simulation can be started from the PX4 **/Firmware** directory using the command:
* Multicopter (jMAVSim): `make px4_sitl jmavsim`
* Multicopter (Gazebo): `make px4_sitl gazebo`
* VTOL (Gazebo):  `make px4_sitl gazebo_standard_vtol`


### Using QGroundControl

You can use *QGroundControl* to connect to PX4 and observe vehicle movement and behaviour while the examples are running.
*QGroundControl* will automatically connect to the PX4 simulation as soon as it is started.

See [QGroundControl > Download and Install](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/en/getting_started/download_and_install.html) for information about setting up *QGroundControl* on your platform.


### Building the Examples {#build_examples}

To build the examples follow the instructions below, replacing *takeoff_and_land* with the name of the specific example.
Any exceptions will be covered in the page for the associated example(s).


#### Linux

Ubuntu or Fedora users should install the MAVSDK C++ _*.deb_ or _*.rpm_ packages from the [Github release page](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK/releases) in the normal way (or [build and install the SDK C++ Library](../contributing/build.md#sdk_system_wide_install) system-wide).

Then build the example:
```sh
cd example/takeoff_land/
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

#### macOS

First [Build and install the SDK C++ Library](../contributing/build.md) system-wide using the command below:
```sh
make clean
make default
sudo make default install
```

Then build the example:
```sh
cd example/takeoff_land/
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```


#### Windows

First [Build and install the SDK C++ Library](../contributing/build.md#build_cpp_windows).
Make sure that you [install the library and headers locally](../contributing/build.md#sdk_local_install) in the standard location:

```sh
cmake --build . --target install
```

Modify the example as described in [Building C++ Apps > SDK Installed Locally](../guide/toolchain.md#sdk_local_install) (this is required for Windows).

Build the example as described in [Building C++ Apps](../guide/toolchain.md#windows). Below we show how for the *takeoff_land* example, but all the other examples are built in the same way:
```sh
cd example/takeoff_land/
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"
cmake --build .
```

> **Note** The debug binary for the example is stored under **\Debug** folder.

### Running the Examples {#running_the_examples}

You can then run the example, specifying the connection URL as the first argument.
When running with the Simulator, you will use the connection string: `udp://:14540`

On Linux/macOS you would run the following (from the **/build** directory):
```sh
./takeoff_and_land udp://:14540
```

For Windows you would run the following (from the **\build\Debug\** directory):
```cmd
.\Debug\takeoff_and_land.exe udp://:14540
```


> **Tip** Most examples will create a binary with the same name as the example.
> The name that is used is specified in the **CMakeLists.txt** file as the first value in the call to `add_executable()`.

If you have already started the simulation the example code should connect to PX4,
and you will be able to observe behaviour through the SDK terminal, SITL terminal, and/or *QGroundControl*.

## Troubleshooting

### Linux: Error loading shared libraries

The following error is raised when you run an application/example on Linux and the MAVSDK shared library cannot be found:

```
error while loading shared libraries: libdronecode_sdk.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

The solution is to update the linker cache so that the system can find the library.
On Ubuntu call the following:
```
sudo ldconfig
```

For more information/other Linux flavours see [Linux Documentation > Shared Libraries](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html).
