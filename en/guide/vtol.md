# VTOL Support

The SDK has basic support for VTOL vehicles. 

> **Note** Most design and test effort has gone into multicopter support. 
> [Get in touch](../README.md#getting-help) if you would like to help enhance the VTOL/Fixed-wing experience! 

## Supported Functionality

Much of the functionality in the SDK is generic, and useful on all vehicle types. 
At time of writing the only *VTOL-specific* functionality are the actions to 
[transition between fixed wing and copter modes](../guide/taking_off_landing.md#transition_vtol).

The SDK can be used to command VTOL vehicles to:

- Take off and land in *multicopter* mode.
- Fly in multicopter mode and transition to fly in fixed wing mode. 
- Fly missions, using the transition actions to switch between fixed wing after takeoff and back to copter before landing.
- Use the camera/gimbal and other generic features.


## Remaining Work

Known omissions:

- You can't include the transition to/from fixed wing in the mission itself, but have to use the transition actions.
- VTOL takeoff in fixed wing mode is not supported.
- More research is required to confirm that no other VTOL APIs are required. 
- VTOL specific testing needs to be considered and implemented.
