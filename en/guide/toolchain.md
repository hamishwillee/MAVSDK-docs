# Building C++ Apps

The MAVSDK core C++ library is written in C++11 and exposes C++11 interfaces such as `std::function`. Therefore, applications using the library need to be C++11 or later as well.

Applications can be built using your preferred build system, compiler and linker toolchain. The only requirement is that the build system must be able to locate the SDK C++ headers and libraries (installed as described [here](../contributing/build.md#install-artifacts)).

The SDK itself uses the [cmake](https://cmake.org/) build system, and we recommend that you do too.
*CMake* is an open-source, cross-platform toolchain that allows you to build your examples on macOS, Linux and Windows using the same build file definition.

Below we explain how to set up a minimal build setup (**CMakeLists.txt**) file for your application.


## Build Definition File - CMakeLists.txt

*Cmake* uses a definition file named **CMakeLists.txt** to define the project. This specifies the name of the project, compiler flags for different platforms and targets, where to find dependencies (libraries and header files), source files to build, and the name of the generated binary. **CMakeLists.txt** is typically stored in the root directory of your app project.

The sections below show how you can set up the file for when the SDK is [installed system wide](../contributing/build.md#sdk_system_wide_install) (the default) or [locally](../contributing/build.md#sdk_local_install).

> **Warning** SDK system-wide installation is not supported on Windows (see [#155](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK/issues/155)).
>  Instead build the app using a [local SDK installation](#sdk_local_install).
>
>  Windows gurus, we'd [love your help](../README.md#getting-help) to implement this).


### SDK Installed System-wide {#sdk_installed_system_wide}

A "template" **CMakeLists.txt** is shown below.
Most of file is boilerplate - the main things you need to change are *your_project_name*, *your_executable_name* and *your_source_file*. You should also make sure that any plugins used by your app are listed in the `target_link_libraries` section.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.12)

# Specify your project's name
project(your_project_name)

# Specify at least C++11
add_definitions("-std=c++11")

# Enable strict handling of warnings
add_definitions("-Wall -Wextra -Werror")

# In case /usr/local/include is not in your default includes
#include_directories(/usr/local/include)

# In case /usr/local/lib is not in your default linker path
#link_directories(/usr/local/lib)

# Specify your app's executable name, and list of source files used to create it.
add_executable(your_executable_name
    your_source_file.cpp
    # ... any other source files
)

# Specify your app's executable name and a list of linked libraries
target_link_libraries(your_executable_name
    mavsdk          #All apps link against mavsdk library
    mavsdk_action      # If action plugin used by app ...
    mavsdk_telemetry   #If telemetry plugin used by app ...
    # ... Any other linked libraries
)
```

> **Note** The file format and required modifications are self-explanatory.
> If additional information is required see the [cmake documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-commands.7.html).


### SDK Installed Locally {#sdk_local_install}

> **Tip** Where possible install the SDK [system wide](../contributing/build.md#sdk_system_wide_install) and follow the instructions in the [previous section](#sdk_installed_system_wide).
You will need to install locally on Windows.

**CMakeLists.txt** is more complicated when the SDK is [installed locally](../contributing/build.md#sdk_local_install),
because you need to specify where the build should find both headers and library files *relative to your current directory*.

You have to change the same information as before: *your_project_name*, *your_executable_name* and *your_source_file*.

> **Note** The example file below assumes that the SDK was installed locally into the directory **MAVSDK/build/default/install/ and that the application is at the same level as the SDK as described in the tree below:
> ```

## Specify your project's name
project(your_project_name)

# Specify at least C++11
add_definitions("-std=c++11")

# Enable strict handling of warnings

endif()

# Specify your app's executable name, and list of source files used to create it.
add_executable(your_executable_name
    your_source_file.cpp
    # ... any other source files

target_link_libraries(your_executable_name
    mavsdk
    mavsdk_action
    mavsdk_telemetry

```


## Building the App

This section assumes that you have already [built and installed the SDK C++ Library](../contributing/build.md) and that your example has a **CMakeLists.txt** in its root directory.

### Linux/macOS

To create and run the app on Linux/macOS:
1. First create a build directory and run *cmake*:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/application/   # Open a prompt and navigate to your application
   mkdir build && cd build   # Create a build directory and navigate into it
   cmake ..   # Create make files for your current platform
   ```
   > **Tip** Make files for release binaries are created by default. Use the flag `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` to build debug binaries:
   ```
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
   ```
1. Build the project
   ```bash
   make
   ```
1. Execute the file (in your build directory):
   ```bash
   ./your_executable_name  # Run your new executable
   ```

### Windows

To create and run the app on Windows:
1. Open the *VS2017 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt*.
1. Navigate to the app source directory and enter the commands as shown below:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/application/   # Open a prompt and navigate to your application
   mkdir build && cd build   # Create a build directory and navigate into it
   cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" # Create make files for your current platform
   cmake --build .  # Build the file
   .\Debug\your_executable_name.exe  # Run your new executable
   ```
