# Building SDK from Source

This section explains how to [build](#build_sdk_cpp) and [install](#install-artifacts) the MAVSDK C++ library from source for all our target platforms.
It also shows how to generate the API Reference documentation.


## Build the C++ Library {#build_sdk_cpp}

This section explains how to build the SDK C++ library from source, along with its unit and integration tests.
Build artifacts are created in the **build** subdirectory.

### macOS {#build_cpp_mac_os}

First install:
* [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (for *clang*)
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (for *cmake*).
  Once you have installed brew, you can install *cmake* via the terminal:
  ```
  brew install cmake
  ```

Then follow the instructions for building the library on [Linux](#build_cpp_linux).

### Linux {#build_cpp_linux}

To build the MAVSDK C++ Library on Linux (or macOS after installing the [preconditions above](#build_cpp_mac_os)):

1. First install the dependencies
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update -y
   sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential colordiff git doxygen -y
   ```
   > **Note** If the build reports a missing dependency, confirm that the set above matches the requirements in the [appropriate docker file for your platform](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK/tree/{{ book.github_branch }}/docker).

1. Clone the [MAVSDK repository](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK) (or your fork):
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK.git
   cd MAVSDK
   ```
1. Checkout the release/branch you want to build (the `develop` branch is checked out by default).
   * Latest stable build (`master`):
     ```
     git checkout master
     ```
   * Head revision with latest features (`develop`):
     ```
     git checkout develop
     ```
1. Update the submodules:
   ```sh
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
1. Build the (debug) C++ library by calling:
   ```sh
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -Bbuild/default -H.
   cmake --build build/default
   ```
   > **Tip** You can build *release* binaries by setting `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` as shown below:
     ```sh
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -Bbuild/default -H.
     cmake --build build/default
     ```
1. "Install" the MAVSDK [as described below](#install-artifacts).


### Windows {#build_cpp_windows}

To build the library in Windows, you need:

- [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/): Download and install (only the "Visual C+ Build Tools" are needed from installer).
- [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/): Download the installer and run it.
  Make sure to tick "add to PATH" during the installation.

To build the MAVSDK C++ Library on Windows:
1. Clone the [MAVSDK repository](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK) (or your fork):
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK.git
   cd MAVSDK
   ```
1. Checkout the release/branch you want to build (the `develop` branch is checked out by default).
   * Latest stable build (`master`):
     ```
     git checkout master
     ```
   * Head revision with latest features (`develop`):
     ```
     git checkout develop
     ```
1. Update the submodules:
   ```sh
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
1. Then build the MAVSDK in Windows:
   ```sh
   cd /your/path/to/MAVSDK
   cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -Bbuild/default -H.
   cmake --build build/default --config Debug
   ```

   > **Tip** You can generate *release* binaries by setting `--config Release` in the build step:
     ```sh
     cmake --build build --config Release
     ```
   <span></span>
   > **Tip** To use more than one CPU core to build set this before building:
     ```sh
     set CL=/MP
     ```

1. "Install" the SDK [as described below](#install-artifacts).


## Install the SDK {#install-artifacts}

*Installing* builds the SDK **and** copies the libraries and header files into a "public" location so that they can be referenced by C++ applications (see [Building C++ Apps](../guide/toolchain.md)).
The SDK supports installation system-wide by default. You can also install files locally/relative to the MAVSDK tree if needed.

> **Warning** System-wide installation is not yet supported on Windows (see [#155](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK/issues/155)) so you will need to [install the SDK locally](#sdk_local_install).
>
> Windows gurus, we'd [love your help](../README.md#getting-help) to implement this).

### System-wide Install {#sdk_system_wide_install}

System-wide installation copies the SDK headers and binaries to the standard system-wide locations for your platform (e.g. on Ubuntu Linux this is **/usr/local/**).

> **Warning** System-wide installation overwrites any previously installed version of the SDK.

To install the SDK system-wide:

```sh
sudo cmake --build build/default --target install # sudo is required to install to system directories!

# First installation only
sudo ldconfig  # update linker cache
```

> **Note** The first time you build the SDK you may also need to [update the linker cache](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html).
  On Ubuntu this is done with `sudo ldconfig`, as shown above.


### Local Install {#sdk_local_install}

Local installation copies the SDK headers/library to a user-specified location inside the SDK source directory.

On Linux/macOS use the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable to specify a path relative to the folder from which you call `cmake`
(or an absolute path).
For example, to install into the **MAVSDK/install/** folder you would call:

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install -Bbuild/default -H.
cmake --build build/default --target install
```

> **Tip** If you already have run *cmake* without setting `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, you may need to clean the build first:
  ```sh
  rm -rf build/default
  ```

## Build for Android {#build_cpp_android}

Build for Android using the dockcross cross compiler, as described in the [cross-compilation](#cross_compilation_dockcross) section below (e.g. with the `dockcross/android-arm64` image).

## Build for iOS {#build_cpp_iOS}

To build for real iOS devices on macOS:

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_BACKEND=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=tools/ios.toolchain.cmake -DPLATFORM=OS -Bbuild/ios -H.
cmake --build build/ios
```

Build for the iOS simulator on macOS:

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_BACKEND=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=tools/ios.toolchain.cmake -DPLATFORM=SIMULATOR64 -Bbuild/ios_simulator -H.
```

> **Note** The commands above build the [mavsdk_server](#build_mavsdk_server) (`-DBUILD_BACKEND=ON`).
  This is required for contributors who want to *extend* the MAVSDK programming-language-specific libraries like [MAVSDK-Swift](http://dronecode-sdk-swift.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/master/index.html), but is not required for developers who just want to *use* C++, *MAVSDK-Swift* or *MAVSDK-Python*.

## Building mavsdk_server {#build_mavsdk_server}

The MAVSDK programming-language-specific libraries (e.g. [Swift](http://dronecode-sdk-swift.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/master/index.html), [Python](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-Python)) share a common backend (called "mavsdk_server").
This may optionally be built as part of the C++ library.

The cmake configuration step additionally depends on the `-DBUILD_BACKEND=ON` option.
Otherwise the build is exactly the same as usual.

> **Tip** When building mavsdk_server, we usually like to link all the dependencies statically, and therefore we set `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF` (or don't specify it, because the default is `OFF`).

### Ubuntu {#build_mavsdk_server_ubuntu}

To build mavsdk_server on Ubuntu:
1. [Setup the C++ Library on Linux](#build_cpp_linux)
1. Navigate into the SDK directory and build the project
   ```
   cd MAVSDK
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_BACKEND=ON -Bbuild/default -H.
   cmake --build build/default
   ```

### macOS {#build_mavsdk_server_macos}

To build mavsdk_server on macOS:
1. [Setup the C++ Library on macOS](#build_cpp_mac_os)
1. Navigate into the SDK directory and build the project
   ```
   cd MAVSDK
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_BACKEND=ON -Bbuild/default -H.
   cmake --build build/default
   ```

### Windows {#build_mavsdk_server_windows}

To build mavsdk_server on Windows:
1. [Setup the C++ Library on Windows](#build_cpp_windows)
1. Navigate into the SDK directory and build the project
   ```
   cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DBUILD_BACKEND=ON -Bbuild/default -H.
   cmake --build build/default
   ```

### Cross compilation using dockcross {#cross_compilation_dockcross}

Cross compilation is usually the fastest way to compile for "embedded" platforms like the Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Blue or Nvidia Jetson (i.e. typically faster than native compilation on device itself).

We recommend using [dockcross](https://github.com/dockcross/dockcross), which is a very convenient tool for cross compilation based on docker (and which supports many platforms).

For example, use the commands below to build for `armv7`:

1. Make sure docker is installed on your system.
2. Navigate into the SDK directory, and use the commands below:
   ```
   cd MAVSDK
   docker run --rm dockcross/linux-armv7 > ./dockcross-linux-armv7
   chmod +x ./dockcross-linux-armv7
   ./dockcross-linux-armv7 cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_BACKEND=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -Bbuild/linux-armv7 -S.
   ./dockcross-linux-armv7 cmake --build build/linux-armv7 -j 8
   ```
3. If all goes well, `mavsdk_server` is built. You can check the file with:
   ```
   ./dockcross-linux-armv7 file build/linux-armv7-release/src/backend/src/mavsdk_server
   build/linux-armv7-release/src/backend/src/mavsdk_server: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (GNU/Linux), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3, for GNU/Linux 4.10.8, not stripped
   ```
4. The newly built binary can now be copied to the device:
   ```
   cp build/linux-armv7/src/backend/src/mavsdk_server somewhere/else
   ```

> **Note** The commands above build the [mavsdk_server](#build_mavsdk_server) (`-DBUILD_BACKEND=ON`).
  This is required for contributors who want to *extend* the MAVSDK programming-language-specific libraries like [MAVSDK-Swift](http://dronecode-sdk-swift.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/master/index.html).
  It is not required for developers who just want to *use* C++, *MAVSDK-Swift* or *MAVSDK-Python*.

## Build API Reference Documentation {#build_api_reference}

The C++ source code is annotated using comments using [Doxygen](http://doxygen.nl/manual/index.html) syntax.

Extract the documentation to markdown files (one per class) on macOS or Linux using the commands:
```bash
rm -rf tools/docs # Remove previous docs
./tools/generate_docs.sh
```
The files are created in **/install/docs/markdown**.

> **Note** Extracting the API reference does not yet work automatically on Windows.

<span></span>
> **Note** The *generate_docs.sh* script [builds the library](../contributing/build.md), installs it locally to **/install**, and then uses *DOxygen* to create XML documentation in **/install/docs/xml**.
> The [generate_markdown_from_doxygen_xml.py](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK/blob/{{ book.github_branch }}/tools/generate_markdown_from_doxygen_xml.py) script
> is then run on all files in the */xml* directory to generate markdown files in **/install/docs/markdown**.


## Troubleshooting

The vast majority of common build issues can be resolved by updating submodules and cleaning the distribution:
```
cd MAVSDK
git submodule update --recursive
rm -rf build
```

Then attempt to build again.
